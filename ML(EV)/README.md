# ‚ö° Probabilistic Forecasting of Flexible Regulation Capabilities in Electric Vehicles  

This project explores how **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** can contribute to the **smart grid** by providing flexible charging and discharging (V2G: Vehicle-to-Grid). Using real-world charging session data, we build **machine learning and deep learning models** to forecast the **flexible regulation capacity (kW)** that EVs can provide at any given time.  

## üìå Objectives
- Predict how much energy EVs can discharge back to the grid without affecting user mobility.  
- Explore **time-series forecasting models** (ARIMA, Prophet) and compare them with **ML/DL models** (XGBoost, LightGBM, LSTM, GRU).  
- Provide a **probabilistic forecast** to capture uncertainty in predictions, useful for grid operators.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python  
- **ML/DL Frameworks**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Time-Series**: ARIMA, Prophet  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn

## üìñ Single Paragraph Detail

This project focuses on forecasting the **flexible regulation capacity** of electric vehicles, which represents the potential for EVs to discharge energy back to the grid without affecting drivers‚Äô mobility needs. By leveraging a real-world EV charging dataset, the work applies a range of models ‚Äî from traditional time-series methods like **ARIMA** and **Prophet** to advanced **machine learning (XGBoost, LightGBM)** and **deep learning (MLP, LSTM, GRU)** approaches. The project not only compares model accuracy but also emphasizes **probabilistic forecasting** to capture uncertainty in predictions, making the results more useful for **grid operators and energy planners** aiming to integrate EVs into smart grid regulation strategies.
